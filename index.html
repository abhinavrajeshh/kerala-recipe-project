     <p> <em>Prepare yourself for a culinary journey that canvases everything from exquisite seafood to ignored vegetables, from coconut milk to crispy curry leaves, from spluttering mustard seeds to soft and spongy appams. Prepare yourself for a scrumptious ride to 'God's own country'. </em> </p><hr>

        The food of Kerala is one that needs no introduction: It's simple, zesty, flavourful and offers an intelligent combination of potent spices. Unlike the cuisine of its neighbouring states, the food of Kerala prides itself on being predominantly non-vegetarian. You've got chicken, mutton, pork, beef and a thrilling range of seafood - mussels, crab, tiger prawns, king prawns, tiny prawns, oysters, sardines, mackerel, tuna and gorgeous red lobsters. </p>  <p>
        Mallu food isn't just about the recipes; it reflects a meeting of cultures. Kerala hindus have a largely vegetarian menu and use coconuts that grow along the coast. Syrian Christians eat more fish and meat, and the Muslims make delicious breads and sizzling biryani. But some techniques and habits remain common through the state; vegetables are cooked with mild spices and steamed in their own juices or cooked in yogurt coconut milk. Rice is the staple food and red rice is commonly eaten. Coconut oil is preferred for cooking and is what gives Malayali cuisine a distinct taste. (Why people eat with their hands in Kerala). <br> <br>
        Kerala is also known as the 'land of spices' and has attracted traders and travelers for centuries. Its mountainous terrain has the perfect climate to support the cultivation of pepper, nutmeg, cardamom,cinnamon, cloves and turmeric. It's probably why they're prominently used in Mallu cooking. Coconut is an indispensable hero of the Kerala cuisine. It's used in everything - from hot curries to soothing desserts. Besides enhancing the taste of the dish, it blends and tones down the potency of the spices. Unripe mango is also used in some fish and vegetable preparations. So is lime juice and vinegar. The pulp extraction of tamarind (in the form of pulp) is also used very often to give the food a unique sour taste. <br></p>
